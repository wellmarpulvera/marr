														<h5>The Ruins, Negros Occidental</h5>

															<h5>Siquijor</h5>
															<p> Stunning beaches are one thing; looking at them from the top of a 50-foot drop is another. In the tiny island of Siquijor, intrepid travelers jump off cliffs into the island's clear, welcoming waters. If Salagdoong Beach's vibrant turquoise does not entice you enough to either take the plunge or keep clicking, jump on a motorbike and drive around the tiny island, visiting Lazi's Cambugahay Falls and 400-year-old balete tree.
