															<h5>Mabua Pebble Beach</h5>
															<p> Mabua Pebble Beach, located 30 minutes from the city center of Surigao, is unique among many of the Filipino beaches due to its multitude of smooth white pebbles that make up its shoreline.While most beaches are formed through the movement of sediment influenced by the wind, waves and currents, Mabua Pebble Beach's unique composition was most likely formed by very strong forward swashing waves that forced the pebble material to be driven onshore, and weaker return swashing waves that caused the material to be deposited.
